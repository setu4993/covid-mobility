The data shows how much people are moving (specifically, making routing requests), comparing to a reference point from January, 2020 before major lockdowns went into place. I have never seen or played with mobility data before, especially from a company like Apple that has customer [privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) at its core and its data so close to its chest, so this was an intriguing opportunity."

    - Data is baselined with the movement data from January 13, 2020 at 100% for each transportation type.
    - Daily data from countries, regions and cities from across the world. The data from India is available for India as a whole and some of India's major cities (namely Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune).
    - Daily means from midnight to midnight PST, not local time. In terms of IST, then, it means the data for January 13, 2020 in the sheet corresponds to approximately (ugh, DST) January 13, 2020 12:30pm to January 14, 2020 12:29pm. In short, everything all dates (and thus the X-axes of all my plots) are off by 1.5 day if I had converted it all to IST. (I did not, because Daylight Savings Time _started_ in mid-March, further complicating the timezone conversions.)
    - Data is available for driving, transit and walking directions, in regions where each of them are available. Since only [driving and walking](https://www.apple.com/ios/feature-availability/) directions are available in India, I can only look at those.
    - Driving directions were not available on Apple Maps in India until fairly recently. Moreover, [90%+ of smartphones in India](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/mobile/india/) run on Android. Even on iOS, I am highly skeptical of the number of people that use Apple Maps (which this data is from) over Google Maps. So, this could be a very small sample set (which is also why it is only available as an aggregate at the country-level and in some major cities).
    - Data for May 11 and May 12 is not available.

        A few additional notes on what I just saw from the graphs above:
        - Walking (relative to driving) continues to go down as the lockdown progresses and the country starts to open up. This is slightly depressing.
        - Mumbai continues to have very limited mobility, but driving dominates walking.
        - Hyderabad appears to be moving towards pre-lockdown levels of mobility for driving and walking is reducing in relation.
        - Most cities are back at or below the baseline walking to driving ratio, with Pune being the only exception.
        - Pune is interesting; mobility is surely going up for both walking and driving, but at more or less the same rate, and thus maybe people continue to prefer walking to driving?
