# COVID Movement Data

I'm playing with the COVID-19 [mobility data released by Apple](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility).

## Tools

- `poetry`: To manage the project.
- `pandas`: To play with the data.
- `altair`: To plot the data.
- `streamlit`: For the front-end.
- `heroku`: To deploy the app to the web.

Some more information about it [here](https://micro.setu.me/posts/playing-apple-covid-mobility-india/).
